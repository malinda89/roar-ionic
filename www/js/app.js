The following three years saw one of the most rapid rates of economic growth in the world, the country becoming a &#x201C;middle-income economy&#x201D;. However, from 2012, growth fell back to less dizzying elevations. Several factors, including corruption and political incompetence, were adduced for the island&#x2019;s economic growth not being sustained, but it is clear that its economy has fundamental structural problems which affect its development.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_12028\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container.jpg%20660w,%20http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-480x320.jpg%20480w,%20http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-550x367.jpg%20550w,%20http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-611x407.jpg%20611w,%20http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-300x200.jpg%20300w\" srcset=\"http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container.jpg 660w, http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-480x320.jpg 480w, http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-550x367.jpg 550w, http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-611x407.jpg 611w, http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/container-300x200.jpg 300w\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12028\" alt=\"Sri Lanka is finding it increasing difficult to pay for its imports.

Sri Lanka could, he felt, be in the same position.</span></p> <p><span>There is a difference, however: innovation does not take place in a vacuum. It is significant that, while </span><a href=\"http://raywijewardene.net/innovation.html\"><span>Ray Wijewardene</span></a><span> developed the technology for two-wheeled tractors, the country does not produce them. J.C.V. Chinappa developed solar-powered refrigeration technology, but Sri Lanka does not use it.</span></p> <p><span>Taiwan&#x2019;s manufacturing sector in 1981 accounted for 29% of GDP, compared to Sri Lanka&#x2019;s 17% today. And garments only accounted for a quarter of Taiwan&#x2019;s manufacturing, in contrast to that sector&#x2019;s preponderance in Sri Lanka&#x2019;s industrial economy. The productive sectors, agriculture and industry, contributed 56% of Taiwan&#x2019;s 1981 GDP, whereas in Sri Lanka, it is the services sector which accounts for 58%.</span></p> <p><span>Renowned economist S.B.D. de Silva points out that, although we have a large garment industry, it has not developed a domestic supply chain, and consists mainly of imported inputs. A developed manufacturing base requires an integrated supply chain, which includes machinery and equipment. &#x201C;Sri Lanka does not produce a single needle,&#x201D; he complains, &#x201C;to supply to the sewing machines of the garment factories.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span>The garments industry uses chlorine and caustic soda, once produced by the Paranthan Chemicals factory, but no attempt has been made either to restart it or to set up new plant adjacent to other salterns which can provide the raw material, brine.</span></p> <figure id=\"attachment_12021\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2-1-e1479553266583.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12021\" alt=\"Ilmenite sand mining.

Over 20 million tonnes of iron ore exist in several locations around the country. Apart from Ilmenite and Thorianite sands on the north east and the south west coasts, from which can be extracted the high-value heavy metals Titanium, Beryllium, Zirconium, and Thorium, there are a variety of other industrial raw materials available, which should be harnessed to value-added industry. </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgE1um2HDAA&amp;t=35s\"><span>Graphite</span></a><span>, for example.</span></p> <h2><span>Industrialisation</span></h2> <p><span>In 2005, a </span><a href=\"http://www.cepa.lk/content_images/publications/documents/145-S-Nicholas-Pro%20Poor%20Macro%20Economic%20Policies.pdf\"><span>UNDP team</span></a><span> led by economists Howard Nicholas and W.D. Lakshman determined that Sri Lanka needed a strategy for rapid and sustainable growth of per capita income levels.</span></p> <p><span>&#x201C;Such a strategy,&#x201D; they concluded, &#x201C;should be founded on export-oriented (and import-substituting) industrialisation, and the promotion of domestic food production. Rural industrialisation should be promoted, but attention needs to be paid to the nature of the products produced and the technologies adopted.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span>However, that was not the policy adopted. Indeed, Successive governments have followed, essentially, service-based growth models. Trade, banking, and property markets rather than agriculture and manufacturing have been seen as driving the economy.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href=\"http://www.investsrilanka.com/images/publications/pdf/CBF_Brochue_boi.pdf\"><span>Mahinda Chinthanaya</span></a><span> envisaged development on the basis of transforming Sri Lanka into a &#x201C;Mega Global Hub&#x201D; in aviation, maritime, energy, knowledge, commerce, and tourism. Earlier this year, the new government intimated that it had </span><a href=\"http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2016/01/17/rajapaksas-five-fold-hub-abolished/\"><span>abandoned</span></a><span> this concept in favour of a &#x201C;Triple Hub&#x201D;, the so-called &#x201C;Western Region Megapolis&#x201D; being developed as a maritime, aviation, logistics, and trade hub of Asia.</span></p> <h2><span>Practical Economics</span></h2> <p><span>Economists such as </span><a href=\"https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/stories/content/2016/abacus_december_2015.pdf\"><span>Nicholas</span></a><span> are not convinced that this is the right way forward.</span></p> <p><span>&#x201C;I think we need to go back to a practical economics which really works,&#x201D; he told </span><i><span>Abacus </span></i><span>magazine. &#x201C;I tell Sri Lankans, &#x2018;Industrialise, go for manufacturing&#x2019;, because there is no alternative. All the other things Sri Lanka has been taught is just not so. It simply has not worked anywhere else, will not work, there is only one strategy, to learn to get to grips with it.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span>Why the lack of emphasis on manufacturing? Experts proffer various explanations. Nicholas thinks is it is because there are vested interests who don&#x2019;t want such a strategy.</span></p> <p><span>&#x201C;It is all the same stories,&#x201D; he complained. &#x201C;I remember in 1994, &#x2018;we can become a computer programming hub for India&#x2019;. In 1995 &#x2018;we can become a financial hub for India&#x2019;. It is such nonsense. Anyone travel to Mumbai recently? Sri Lanka a financial hub for India? They must be out of their minds.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span>Power-sector consultant Tilak Siyambalapitiya thinks that it is because of the high cost of energy inputs; our economy is service-oriented, so we use less electricity.</span></p> <p><span> &#x201C;To produce a dollar worth of output from services,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;requires less electricity than to produce a dollar worth of output from manufacturing. Why we are not getting industries into the country, despite having raw materials for them, for example in the ceramics, glass and cement industries? This is because of the high energy cost. Energy is too expensive.&#x201D;</span></p> <h2><span>Agrarian Backwardness</span></h2> <p><span>However, S.B.D. de Silva, who was a former deputy-director of the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute, thinks it is because of the backwardness of agricultural sector. He points out that the Industrial Revolution in Britain took off on the basis of the development of the agricultural sector. The introduction of a year-round, four-course system, involving rotation of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat crops, combined with the horse-hoeing agricultural mechanisation of Jethro Tull, increased the productivity of farmers, releasing labour for the new factories, as well as creating a market for industrial goods. However, he says, our agricultural sector remains backward and pre-capitalist: farmers do not have enough surplus to become a major driver of investment or to provide a sufficient internal market.</span></p> <figure id=\"attachment_12023\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JethroTullPlough-e1479553079910.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12023\" alt=\"Jethro Tull&apos;s Plough, which contributed to Britain&apos;s Industrial Revolution.

It believes that Sri Lanka&#x2019;s agricultural sector is at a &#x201C;strategic cross-road&#x201D;. Although the long sought-after goal of rice self-sufficiency has been achieved, it says,</span></p> <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2026; the share of population employed in agriculture has remained at about 30 % over the past 10 years, even as the share of the sector in national GDP has continued to decline to 10 percent. This implied and persistent inequality adds to the urgency to rethink the strategic direction of future agricultural development &#x2013; how to sustainably increase rural incomes and promote the development of a modern agriculture sector that meets the needs of an upper-middle-income country that Sri Lanka aspires to be.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span>In June, the World Bank approved a $125 million credit line from the International Development Association to assist Sri Lanka to modernise its agriculture sector and make it more efficient, more responsive to consumer demand, and more environmentally sustainable and resilient to climate change. The project, to be implemented in five provinces, is intended to benefit 50,000 smallholder farm households directly or indirectly. It will fund agricultural value chain development to promote commercial and export-oriented agriculture, focussing especially on higher value fruits and vegetables; improvements to productivity and diversification of growing patterns through modern agriculture technology demonstrations in the project areas; new institutional arrangements in the form of farmer organisations and farmer-agribusiness partnerships; and policy development, enabling the Government to decide the future direction of the agricultural sector.</span></p> <h2><span>Structural Reform</span></h2> <figure id=\"attachment_12024\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Rice-combine-harvester-Hambantota-e1479553575221.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12024\" alt=\"Rice combine harvester, Hambantota. A majority of Sri Lankan farmers are involved in paddy farming at a subsistence level.\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rice combine harvester, Hambantota. A majority of Sri Lankan farmers are involved in paddy farming at a subsistence level.</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However, this initiative depends heavily on dry-land cultivation of alternative crops, not on reform of the existing paddy sector subsistence economy. S.B.D. de Silva thinks that there needs to be deep-going structural reform.</span></p> <p><span>He argues that Sri Lanka&#x2019;s economic woes can be traced back to our inability to break out of the constraints of a colonial economy. The majority of farmers are involved in paddy farming at a subsistence level &#x2013; most of their produce is for home consumption, and only a small surplus is left over for trading. Traditional farmers do produce for the market, but this is in subsidiary crops in their home gardens and in their slash-and-burn</span><i><span> chenas </span></i><span>in the forests,</span> <span>which also provided fruits and herbs, while protecting the watershed</span><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>The British-enacted Crown Lands (Encroachment) Ordinance of 1840 and Wastelands Ordinance of 1897, expropriated the forest and common lands of the farmers, effectively cutting them off from their market-production. This colonial legacy remains. The primary problems associated with the traditional paddy sector, according to de Silva, are farmer indebtedness and labour underemployment. They both arise partly from the fact that farmers are dependent on the monsoon. Sri Lanka&#x2019;s irrigation system does not provide sufficient water for year-round cultivation, and the nature of the paddy field does not allow for off-season crops. Hence, for the inter-monsoonal months, farm labour is unemployed &#x2013; which does not show up in the unemployment figures. The seasonal nature of their unemployment also does not allow them to join the industrial labour force, resulting in an imbalance between job vacancies and labour availability.</span></p> <p><span>The imbalance between industrial labour shortage and rural underemployment crops up even in the apparently advanced industrial economy of</span><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6906e/x6906e0c.htm\"> <span>Thailand</span></a><span> &#x2013; which has not carried out reforms in the agrarian sector, unlike the East Asian countries. The result is a manufacturing sector heavily dependent on exports, lacking an internal market and facing a chronic labour shortage.</span></p> <h2><span>Practical Solutions</span></h2> <p><span>According to traditional paddy variety farmer H.G. Maithripala, of Anamaduwa, the problem can be alleviated if there is an off-season crop. In irrigated dry zone areas, this can be done fairly simply, by starting the crop earlier. The Government officers concerned must be galvanised into action in February (for </span><i><span>Yala</span></i><span>) and in August (for </span><i><span>Maha</span></i><span>), when farmers have plenty of time on their hands, to arrange Seasonal Meetings (</span><i><span>Kanna Resweem</span></i><span>) long before the rains arrive, to assess the likely weather patterns and to arrange for adequate supplies of seed paddy, earlier than now. At present, the officers are only galvanised at the onset of the rains, when the farmers need to be busy in their fields; they need to be instructed to start discharge of irrigation waters early, to enable off-season cultivation, so tanks can be replenished in time for the main season.</span></p> <figure id=\"attachment_12022\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20161119_100926-e1479552906579.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12022\" alt=\"The problem can be alleviated if there is an off-season crop - H.G. Maithripala, traditional paddy farmer. Image courtesy writer.\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The problem can be alleviated if there is an off-season crop &#x2013; H.G. Maithripala, traditional paddy farmer. Image courtesy writer.</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Otherwise, it is necessary to find markets for and popularise the cultivation of alternative, wet-land crops, which may require considerable research; attempts to grow moong beans on paddy fields have been less than successful. One alternative is to popularise </span><a href=\"http://commonsabundance.net/docs/dry-rice-cultivation-2/\"><span>dry cultivation of paddy</span></a><span> in the off-season.</span></p> <p><span>Maithripala thinks that the main solution to indebtedness is to have a dynamic, limited purchase guaranteed-price scheme. This would entail early discussions between the purchasing officers and groups of farmers to determine what the harvest is likely to be. The officers need to determine an amount to be purchased, which will leave each farmer with adequate stocks for family consumption and sale on the open market, if necessary. The farmers need to be given some lead time to prepare their paddy for collection, during which time the officers need to arrange the funds for payment on the nail, to prevent indebtedness to usurious lenders.</span></p> <h2><span>East Asian Model</span></h2> <p><span>We could look at how the East Asian &#x201C;Tiger Economies&#x201D; industrialised. South Korea and Taiwan carried out land reform far deeper going than Sri Lanka&#x2019;s (the land ownership ceiling was three hectares in their case, compared to our ten hectares for paddy land), and modernised their agrarian sectors. The resultant, broader land-ownership created an internal market which, in tandem with import restrictions, served as a basis for rapid industrialisation. Once the industrial foundation was laid, an export-led strategy was adopted, but the internal market was protected.</span></p> <p><span>Sri Lanka could well follow a similar strategy. A consumer goods sector, serving the agrarian market, could be constructed, using machinery produced by a heavy industry sector built upon the basis of the necessities of a mechanised agrarian sector.</span> </p> <p><span>In future, it may be necessary to consider the economy holistically, with an understanding of how each sector affects the others. An &#x201C;ecosystem&#x201D; for rapid and self-reliant development needs to be created, and this requires state planning, as for example was done in </span><a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTABCDESK2009/Resources/Ha-Joon-Chang.pdf\"><span>Japan, Korea, and Taiwan</span></a><span>, and arguably, </span><a href=\"https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2016/09/22/singapore-as-a-model-for-economic-transformation-case-of-state-planning-or-markets/\"><span>Singapore</span></a><span>. Sri Lanka has the know-how, the personnel and even the mechanisms in place to do so, but has lacked the political will.</span></p> <p><em>Featured image courtesy thesrilankasceneries.blogspot.com</em></p> </div>";
  var article2 = "<div class=\"article-content-box\"> <p>Ever thought of Sri Lanka recognising her doppelg&#xE4;nger?</p> <p>Perhaps if you haven&#x2019;t, let&#x2019;s consider bringing Kerala, a state sewn against the Malabar Coast of South India, into the picture. What&#x2019;s more &#x2012; a link between the two places can be traced back as far as the &#x2018;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattini\">Pattini</a>&#x2019; (a guardian deity of Sri Lanka) cult from the Chera country, as Kerala was once known. The similarities shared by both regions are, in fact, astonishing upon close scrutiny. </p> <h2>Coconut</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11673\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/kerala-1-e1479394899126.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11673 size-full\" alt=\"Coconut palms in the village of Anjengo, Kerala.

Image Credit: Emmanuel Dyan/National Geographic Traveller India</figcaption></figure> <p>The answer to the question of where coconuts first originated is an unsettling one. However, Kerala that prides itself with the populous of coconuts throughout the region seems to have earned its name from <i>kera</i> meaning coconut palm in the Malayalam language. In fact, as one of Kerala&#x2019;s ever-fertile plantations, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_production_in_Kerala\">coconut covers 40% of the land</a> and remains one of the state&#x2019;s most revered procurement benefitted by both its economy and culture. This can be also identified in Sri Lanka. Our very own <i>pol </i>has been blessed, in the same vein, with a sharp strength in number in and around the coastal belts, with approximately <a href=\"http://www.news.lk/news/business/item/5299-sri-lanka-tops-the-brown-fiber-export-market\">2,500 million nuts produced islandwide each year.</a> Coconuts, as a result, are a big deal in Sri Lankan cuisine. Almost every dish in Kerala and Sri Lanka comes complete with coconut whether in the form of oil, desiccated or scraped coconut, or coconut milk, though of course, the food of each region is infused with their own unique flavour.</p> <h2>Toddy</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11679\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/04-e1479395061607.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11679 size-full\" alt=\"A Sri Lankan toddy tapper. Image credit: Roar.lk/Nazly Ahmed\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Sri Lankan toddy tapper. Image credit: Roar.lk/Nazly Ahmed</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Illavar or Ezhava community of Kerala who once established toddy tapping as one of their chief occupations, among others such as coir making, are said to have moved into Malabar from Ceylon. According to legends, the practice of toddy tapping can be traced back to the Chera Kingdom of Travancore in the 1</span><span>st</span><span> century CE. It seems the Ezhavas were the descendents of a few bachelors that the King of Ceylon at the time had shipped off to Kerala at Chera King Bhaskara Ravi Varma&#x2019;s behest, for the setting up of coconut farming in Kerala. Based on this, it is perhaps easy to believe that Sri Lanka may have had an influence on toddy tapping in Kerala, although there has been no actual record of this. Today, the precarious climb for toddy is a arguably a unique area of expertise on its own. The cotton-white liquid extracted as sap from the tree is wholly non-alcoholic before thrown into fermentation and the dipsomania attained thereafter. Toddy, which is believed to be a sacred offering to the Gods, is famously known as</span><i><span> kallu</span></i><span> or</span><i><span> kali</span></i><span> in regions of Kerala and served along with </span><i><span>kappa-meen</span></i><span> curry (a local fish curry) at every toddy shop around; here in Sri Lanka, </span><span>the toddy sphere includes </span><i><span>thal ra, kithul ra, </span></i><span>or the</span><i><span> pol ra </span></i><span>best stored in earthen pots.</span></p> <h2>Spice Trade</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11674\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/vasco-route-e1479395188249.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11674 size-full\" alt=\"The Route taken by Vasco De Gama to India.

Sri Lanka was not too far off, being much the same in the lead even after the Europeans invaded. In addition to this, </span><a href=\"http://bewitchingnames.blogspot.com/2010/12/cinnamon.html\"><span>Arab Persian </span><span>Zakariya al-Qazwini </span></a><span> in 1270 recorded that cinnamon was native to Sri Lanka &#x2012; which today produces 90% of world&#x2019;s cinnamon. Eventually, the spice trade opened doors to migration from and to the island, and Kerala experienced a similar fate. Both places thus held mutual significance in the taste and trade of spices despite undergoing problematic colonial invasions. </span></p> <h2>Ayurveda</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11681\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/slide-1-1-e1479395418353.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11681 size-full\" alt=\"Ayurveda, containing healing properties, is known for its perfect mix of balance and bliss.

Sources suggest that Kerala was under the influence of Buddhism; this, along with the congenial atmosphere and the rich soil helped to deeply nurture the science of Ayurveda, aided by the Sanskrit texts. Further, evidence claims that many Ezhavas were competent ayurvedic physicians, and among them the best known was Itti Achuthan, an Ezhava himself.

Image courtesy: thehindu.com</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Fish, to both Sri Lankan and Kerala cuisine, is unavoidable as well as vital. It&#x2019;s no surprise that one of the most celebrated foods in Sri Lanka comprises of what is freshly caught and what smells strong. The island offers a variety of over 200 fish to eat, including yellowfin tuna (</span><i><span>kelawalla</span></i><span>), sail fish (</span><i><span>thalapath</span></i><span>), and spanish mackerel (</span><i><span>thora malu</span></i><span>). One of Sri Lanka&#x2019;s favourite fish dishes is undoubtedly the </span><i><span>ambul thiyal, </span></i><span>prepared with halibut or tuna in a bath of gravy, a Southern hot and peppery specialty. Similarly, the Malayalee fish curries are endless &#x2012; from </span><i><span>fish mappa</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>meen alleppey</span></i><span>, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aldbxXx9k8M\"><i><span>karimeen</span></i></a><i><span> (pearl spot fish) fry, </span></i><span>which remains a prominent dish served on a banana leaf.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to this, fruits such as bananas and pineapples grow in abundance thanks to the tropical effect. The breakfast of both Lankans and Malayalees very much belong to the aesthetics of kindred spirits as well. The </span><i><span>appam, idiyappam </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>puttu </span></i><span>have slightly been altered</span> <span>in name and serving only (with a dollop of </span><i><span>katta sambol </span></i><span>accompanying the Sri Lankan meal).</span></p> <h2>Elephants</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11675\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/Elephants_of_Kandy_Esala_Perahera-e1479396084805.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11675 size-full\" alt=\"Elephants at the Kandy Esala Perahera. Image courtesy: wikimedia.org \"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elephants at the Kandy Esala Perahera. Image courtesy: wikimedia.org</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As Indian author, Shashi Tharoor, accurately puts it, &#x201C;Elephants infuse the Kerala consciousness.&#x201D; [2] Deeply embedded are the islanders&#x2019; sentiments for elephants, too. This can be witnessed at the Kandy Esala Perahera festival in the months of July and August every year. The ceremony comes complete with brightly primped up elephants in ornaments swaying as if hit by a breeze&#x2014; one of them in charge of the Sacred Casket stored under a well-crafted shelter on its back, until the destination, the Dalada Maligawa, is reached. Likewise, in Kerala, there occurs the Thrissur Pooram; a Hindu temple festival graced by a neat stream of elephants draped with elaborate headdresses and crafted umbrellas. Scholars also have pointed out the exporting of ivory to the West from both Ceylon and the Malabar coast during the early centuries. Elephants have indeed made a vivid impact on both cultures, and were considered valuable for mercenaries in the island as much as for the Malayalees in the Indian mainland.</span></p> <figure id=\"attachment_11676\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/pooram-e1479396150918.jpeg\" class=\"wp-image-11676 size-full\" alt=\"Thrissur Pooram festival, Kerala.

This, in a sense, establishes the migrants of Malayalee progeny to the island. Moreover, sources say that Markar is a name commonly found in Cochin. </span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, with regards to physical features, both Sri Lankans and Malayalees possess many similarities, beginning with a complexion that ranges from wheatish to dark brown. </span></p> <p><span>Dennis McGilvray in his paper, claimed the Moorish identity in the coasts of Malabar and Sri Lanka, is said to have been the result of the medieval Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms allowing Arab merchants to settle for fiscal (in ports such as Calicut and Colombo) and perhaps later, inter-marriage purposes. [3] This not only unifies the waking of ethnic development with Islamic impact on the two regions before the British and the Dutch colonial rulings began, but also supports the theory of the spice trade as mentioned earlier.</span></p> <p><span>The Caste system plays a very strong role in the South Asian context. Exploring further, the Rodiyas seem to be the widely sourced untouchables amongst the caste system of the Sinhala people. Among the Shudras of Kerala on the other hand, the Paraiyars were of the lowest traditional Indian social class. Both, during the 18th and 19 centuries, experienced the worst conditions in the hands of colonisers and kings with their rights taken away (such as the prerogative to cover their upper bodies) and were often oppressed: either deemed culpable, or required to do the dirty work.</span></p> <p><span>Other historical similarities include the devotional cults of Naga (snake) worshipping among Sri Lankan Tamils, which have clear connections in religious beliefs with the Nair community of Kerala, as it is still practised today.</span></p> <p><span>While social interactions between Kerala and Sri Lanka were established through port settlements in the early centuries, the migrant workers of Kerala settled in the Middle East for better employment opportunities, in a manner similar to that of the Lankan migration to the Gulf. Even with finer influx of revenue attained, it seems that the lifestyles of workers from both places remains deplorable and unregulated. Many Sri Lankans and Malayalees live without proper sanitation and living conditions, thus making even our adversities all the more mutual. </span></p> <h2>Arts And Architecture</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11687\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/17-3-Traditional-Devil-Masks-7-e1479396386423.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11687 size-full\" alt=\"A Sri Lankan devil mask dancer.

Image courtesy: gatewaylankatours.com</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The town of Ambalangoda is known for its mask-making industry. Such traditions, including devil dancing, are said to have absorbed some influence mainly from the cities of Kerala and Malabar with more techniques added in the manufacture of masks as it has evolved today. Meanwhile, an important element to also note is the Angampora, the traditional martial art of the Sinhalese which possesses similarities to Kalari Payattu, a Dravidian combat system practised in parts of Kerala.</span></p> <figure id=\"attachment_11686\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://life.roar.lk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/11/kathakali-e1479396517680.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-11686 size-full\" alt=\"Kerala is famous for kathakali - another dance form involving a mask and a colourful costume.
